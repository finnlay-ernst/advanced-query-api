# advanced-query-api
This branch is a version I explored that fully generifies the binding of advanced query parameters.

The developer can simply pass the model of the object they are querying and all supported properties of that model 
will receive advanced query support.

Swagger is also automatically configured.


Shelved for now as the process of formatting those query parameter objects into a query in the provider proved chalenging and potentially computationally costly.
